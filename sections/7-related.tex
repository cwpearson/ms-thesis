\section{System Topology Enumeration / Hardware Models}

hwloc~\cite{broquedis2010hwloc} is designed around the expectation that current and next-generation systems are hierarchical.
This work proposes a tool that leverages \texttt{hwloc}, but is designed around the expectation that systems will be better modeled as a graph.

\cite{amaral2017topology} use a similar hardware model, graph partitioning, estimating communication cost.

\section{System Characterization}

Prior work has examined the performance penalty of incorrect NUMA mappings in multi-GPU systems.
Spafford, Meredith, and Vetter~\cite{spafford2011quantifying} show significant anisotropy and bandwidth degredation in PCIe bandwidth for incorrect NUMA pinnings. \todo{They also discuss some performance effect on applications and performance under contention}.


MGBench, a multi-GPU communication benchmark~\cite{bennun2016mgbench}.
SHOC, the Scalable Heterogeneous Computing Benchmark Suite~\cite{danalis2010scalable}.


Prior work has investigated unified memory performance in CUDA systems.
Li et. al. examine several HPC applications, and attribute reduced UM performance to redundant memory transfers and page faults~\cite{li2015evaluation}.
Landaverde et. al.~\cite{landaverde2014investigation}.
