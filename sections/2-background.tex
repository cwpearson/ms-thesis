\section{System Communication Abstraction}
\label{sec:sys-abstraction}

Application access to computing systems is made through a stack of abstractions.
This work considers applications that interface with the system through CUDA, the Linux NUMA abstraction, and OpenMP.
Those API calls are implemented in various libraries, such as \texttt{libcudart.so} on linux systems.
In turn, those libraries make use of system calls provided by the operating system.
The operating system interfaces with various drivers, including the Nvidia GPU drivers and the interconnect drivers, to make use of the underlying hardware.
Figure~\ref{fig:app-abstraction} shows a schematic of this stack.

		The application interacts with the underlying hardware through libraries, the operating system, and drivers.
	}
    \label{fig:app-abstraction}
\end{figure}

Through these layers of abstraction, the underlying communication capabilities are modified.
For example, PCIe interconnects transfer data with packets, but the CUDA API does not expose the ability to create custom packets to send to the GPU.
Furthermore, the performance of the hardware is modified.
For example, when CUDA unified memory is used, some of the link bandwidth may be consumed by control signals that help ensure data coherence.
Chapters \ref{ch:explicit} and \ref{ch:unified} and~ show how different uses of the CUDA API can achieve different performance on the same physical hardware.

\section{GPUs and System Architecture}
\label{sec:gpu-sys-arch}

Nvidia GPUs used in high-performance computing are fully-discrete accelerators.
From the software side, they demand explicit management through the Nvidia Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming system: a set of C++ language extensions and libraries.
In a GPU-accelerated application, the CPU typically acts as a manager and ``offloads'' specialized compute tasks to the GPU.
From the hardware perspective, GPUs are separated from the CPU and memory by an interconnect link.
The GPU has its own local memory, which must be populated with data for the GPU to operate on.
For the rest of this thesis, we will refer to the system memory associated with that CPU as the ``CPU memory'' or ``system memory'', and the GPU's local memory as ``GPU memory''.
Finally, though not covered in this work, the GPU compute cores have dramatically different performance characteristics than CPU cores, and require specialized programming styles.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:gpu-sys-arch} shows some example interconnect bandwidth numbers for some hypothetical systems.
In all cases, the bandwidth between the CPU or GPU and their respective memories is much higher than the bandwidth between the CPU and GPU.
In older systems and current x86 systems, that link may be an order of magnitude slower than the other interconnects.
The vastly different link performance makes data placement extremely important for application performance.

\section{PCIe and NVLink Interconnects}
\label{sec:interconnects}

Modern systems with discrete GPUs feature either NVLink or PCIe accelerator interconnects.
These interconnects couple the GPUs to the CPUs and/or other GPUs.
Table~\ref{tab:interconnect-overview} summarizes the theoretical bandwidth of common interconnect configurations.
Figure~\ref{fig:interconnect-cartoon} shows example PCIe and NVLink topologies.
Section~\ref{sec:cuda-peer} describes how these topologies affect parts of the CUDA peer-communication API.

    \label{fig:interconnect-cartoon}
\end{figure}

The Nvidia DGX-1 system (Section~\ref{sec:dgx1}) uses PCIe to connect CPUs to GPUs, and single-lane NVLink 1.0 to connect amongst GPUs.
The IBM S822LC system (Section~\ref{sec:s822lc}) uses two NVLink 1.0 lanes to connect pairs of devices, with each lane operating at 20 GB/s.
The IBM AC922 system (Section~\ref{sec:ac922}) uses three NVLink 2.0 lanes to connect pairs of devices, with each lane operating at 25 GB/s.

\subsection{PCIe}

Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) is an expansion bus standard~\cite{pcie10}.
PCIe components form a tree, rooted at the \textit{root complex}.
PCIe devices such as GPUs or SSDs are \textit{endpoints}, with a single upstream port and no downstream ports.
Data is sent point-to-point between participating endpoints and/or the root complex via unique PCIe addresses.
The topology also may include \textit{switches}, components with a single upstream port and multiple downstream ports.
Switches do not receive data packes, and are only used to extend the topology.
Components are connected by PCIe \textit{links}, each of which consists of one to 32 lanes.
The total bandwidth of the link depends on the PCIe generation and the number of lanes.
Figure~\ref{fig:pcie-cartoon} shows an example topology.
The PCIe 3.0 specification~\cite{pcie30} was finalized in 2010, and the first Nvidia GPUs to support it were some Kepler-architecture products released in 2012~\cite{nyland2012inside}.

Table~\ref{tab:pcie-lane-rates} shows single-lane PCIe bandwidths from generation $1.0$ to $3.0$.
Physically, each PCIe lane has four wires, divided into two differential signaling pairs.
A PCIe 3.0 x16 interconnect therefore has 64 wires.
In PCIe 3.0, each signaling pair operates at 8 Gb/s.
With a 128b/130b encoding, this gives PCIe 3.0 x16 a 15.8 GB/s unidirectional bandwidth.

	\centering

	\label{tab:pcie-lane-rates}
	\begin{tabular}{cccc}
		\hline
		\textbf{PCIe Revision} & \textbf{Signaling Rate} & \textbf{Encoding} & \textbf{Line Bandwidth} \\ \hline
		\textbf{1.0}           & $2.5$ GT/s                & $8$b/$10$b            & $250$   MB/s      \\ \hline
		\textbf{2.0}           & $5.0$ GT/s                & $8$b/$10$b            & $500$   MB/s      \\ \hline
		\textbf{3.0}           & $8.0$ GT/s                & $128$b/$130$b         & $984.6$ MB/s      \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{NVLink}

NVLink is a communication protocol developed by Nvidia.
Current NVLink implementations use a proprietary High-Speed Signaling interconnect called NVHS \cite{harris2016insidepascal}.
Like PCIe, each NVLink connects two devices.
Unlike PCIe, there is no concept of upstream or downstream ports, and devices may have multiple ports.
Multiple links may connect devices, in which case the links are combined to contribute to the available bandwidth between devices.
Figure~\ref{fig:nvlink-cartoon} shows an example topology.
The NVLink 1.0 systems in this work allow each device to have four NVLink lane connections, with each lane running at 20 GB/s~\cite{nvidia2017dgx1}~\cite{nvidia2016p100}.
The NVLink 2.0 systems in this work allow each device to have six NVLink lanes at 25 GB/s each~\cite{nvidia2017v100}.

Physically, each bidirectional lane has 32 wires, divided evenly into two unidirectional sublinks of eight differential pairs~\cite{harris2016insidepascal}.
Each pair operates at 20 Gb/s for NVLink 1.0 and 25 Gb/s for NVLink 2.0.
This means a 2-lane NVLink 1.0 has 64 wires.
The improved bandwidth of 2-lane NVLink 1.0 vs PCIe 3.0 is directly attributable to the signaling rate on the wires.

\section{CUDA}
\label{sec:cuda}

Nvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a programming system for enabling general-purpose computation on Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units).
CUDA is a set of C extensions and libraries for interfacing with GPUs.
Nvidia provides a compiler, \texttt{nvcc} for generating CUDA-enabled binaries.

CUDA provides a set of runtime and driver APIs for the developer to manage the allocation and movement of data between the host and device memory.
From its inception, CUDA provided comprehensive APIs for developers to mitigate application performance shortfalls stemming from the relatively limited performance of host-device communication links.
As the capabilities of GPUs and host systems have improved, CUDA has provided simpler, higher-level APIs that require less programmer effort.
This section describes CUDA memory-management capabilities and the historical context of their introduction.

The CUDA API has an associated version number that defines which CUDA actions are made available by that API.
CUDA-capable hardware advertises a specific compute capability (CC) that defines what CUDA actions are supported by that GPU.
Although the CUDA API may expose particular capability, the GPU may need a sufficiently high CC to take advantage of it.
This section references both these version systems when discussing CUDA features.

This work focuses on the performance of explicit CUDA memory management and the CUDA unified memory system.
There is a third set of transfer capabilities that fall under the umbrella of remote-mapping or ``zero-copy'' memory.
These techniques are subsumed by Unified Memory, though making use of them typically requires hints to the CUDA system.
Once the flexibility of the Unified memory system improves, it will be important to revisit the performance implications zero-copy memory.

\subsection{Basic CUDA Memory and System Memory}
\label{sec:basic-cuda}

Prior to the introduction of Unified Virtual Addressing (see Section~\ref{sec:uva}), the CUDA memory space was composed of multiple address spaces: one for the host, and one for each GPU~\cite{schroeder2011peer}.
Data was explicitly allocated in those address spaces through \texttt{cudaMalloc}.
Standard C/C++ memory allocation techniques (\texttt{malloc}/\texttt{new}, \texttt{free}/\texttt{new}) are used for managing memory on the host.
\texttt{cudaMemcpy} is used to move data between address spaces, whether the host and device or between devices.
Since each device has a separate address space, the programmer explicitly instructs \texttt{cudaMemcpy} how to move data with \texttt{cudaMemcpyHostToDevice}, \texttt{cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost}, or \texttt{cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice}.
Basic CUDA memory management runtime calls described in Table~\ref{tab:cuda-basic-apis}.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\caption[Basic Memory-management APIs]{
		Basic CUDA Memory-Management APIs and C/C++ APIs
	}
	\label{tab:cuda-basic-apis}
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		\hline
		\textbf{CUDA API}          & \textbf{Description}                         \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaSetDevice()}   & Associate a device with the host thread.     \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaMalloc()}      & Allocate memory on the device.               \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaFree()}        & Free memory on the device.                   \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaMemcpy()}      & Copy data between to,from,and between GPUs.  \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaMemcpyPeer()}  & Copy data between GPUs without CPU involved. \\ \hline
		\hline 
		\textbf{C/C++ API}         & \textbf{Description}                         \\ \hline
		\texttt{new / malloc()}    & Allocate pageable memory on the system heap. \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\texttt{cudaMemcpy} is only partially asynchronous with respect to the host(\cite{nvidia2014cuda60runtime}, ch. 1).
It will return once the pageable source allocation is safe to modify, but possibly before the data has finished moving to the device.
This impacts the design of the performance characterization routines in Chapter~\ref{ch:explicit}
\texttt{cudaMemcpyPeer} initiates a DMA copy from one GPU to another, without involving the host.
This can improve the bandwidth of the transfer between supported devices.
The impact of this peer access is also described in Chapters~\ref{ch:explicit} and~\ref{ch:unified}.

This API definition imposes the following basic structure on all CUDA programs, which remains essentially unchanged through CUDA 9.1.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item allocate memory on the host with \texttt{new}/\texttt{malloc}.
	\item initialize memory on the host
	\item allocate memory on the device with \texttt{cudaMalloc}
	\item copy initialized data from the host to the device with 
	\newline \texttt{cudaMemcpy(..., cudaMemcpyHostToDevice)}
	\item launch CUDA kernels
	\item copy results back to the host with 
	\newline \texttt{cudaMemcpy(..., cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost)}
	\item free CUDA allocations with \texttt{cudaFree}
\end{enumerate}

Unified virtual addressing (Section~\ref{sec:uva}) and unified memory (Section ~\ref{sec:unified-cc3}) allow the data transfer steps to happen implicitly on supported systems.

\subsection{Page-Locked Memory}
\label{sec:pinned-memory}

The GPU uses direct memory access (DMA) to copy data to and from the host.
When \texttt{cudaMemcpy} is invoked, the CPU instructs the GPU to copy a region of host memory to the device memory (or vis-versa), without the CPU being involved.
The host must guarantee that the memory to be accessed by the GPU will not be paged-out during the copy.
First, \texttt{cudaMemcpy} copies the data from the application address space to a piece of page-locked memory in the system memory managed by the CUDA driver, and then \texttt{cudaMemcpy} instructs the GPU to initiate the DMA from that page-locked region to the GPU memory.

The CUDA runtime functions in Table~\ref{tab:cuda-pinned-apis} are the core functions CUDA provides to make page-locked memory regions directly visible to the application.
When the application uses these APIs, the first copy from pageable host memory to page-locked host memory can be elided.
Section~\ref{sec:explicit-pageable-pinned-wc} demonstrates the performance improvement from skipping this first copy.
Overuse of page-locked memory on the host will degrade overall application performance or even impact system stability if the host system is not able to page as needed.

\begin{table}[ht]

	\label{tab:cuda-pinned-apis}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{M{1.5in} Y M{0.9in}}
		\hline
		\textbf{API}                & \textbf{Description}                    & \textbf{CUDA Version Introduced} \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaMallocHost()}   & allocate page-locked memory on the host & 1.0~\cite{nvidia2007cuda10} \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaFreeHost()}     & free page-locked memory on the host     & 1.0~\cite{nvidia2007cuda10} \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaHostAlloc()}    & cudaMallocHost with additional options  & 3.0~\cite{nvidia2010cuda30} \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaHostRegister()} & Page-lock a range of host memory        & 4.0~\cite{nvidia2011cudac40} \\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\begin{sloppypar}
\texttt{cudaHostAlloc} allows even more options, including the \texttt{cudaHostAllocPortable} and \texttt{cudaHostAllocWriteCombined} flags.
%3.2.4.2
\texttt{cudaHostAllocWriteCombined} causes a pinned allocation to be write-combined.
Writes to write-combined memory may be delayed and combined in a buffer to reduce the number of memory accesses.
Additionally, the host may not cache this data in L1 or L2 cache, freeing up those resources for other applications.
This may prevent unnecessary cache invalidations from occurring during the DMA.
Furthermore, coherency is not enforced, so data is not snooped on the PCIe bus, which can increase bandwidth by up to 40\% (\cite{nvidia2010cuda30}, 3.2.5.2).
Due to the possible lack of caching, this type of allocation makes sense for data that is not frequently read by the CPU, for example, data written once by the CPU before being sent to a GPU.
\end{sloppypar}

%3.2.4.3 
% \begin{sloppypar}
% \texttt{cudaHostAllocMapped} introduces the ability to map the host allocation (in the host address space) into the device's address space.
% By using \texttt{cudaHostGetDevicePointer}, the corresponding pointer in the device address space may be obtained and directly used by CUDA kernels.
% In this case, the programmer does not need to explicitly allocate memory or copy data to the device, nor does the programmer need to use streams to overlap computation with communication.
% \end{sloppypar}

\texttt{cudaHostAllocPortable} allows all CUDA contexts to treat the memory as pinned, not just the context that performed the allocation.
This became the default with the introduction of unified virtual addressing.

\subsection{Unified Virtual Addressing}
\label{sec:uva}

Unified Virtual Addressing was introduced with compute capability 2.0 GPUs and CUDA 4.0 on 64-bit systems.
The host memory and the memory of each GPU are mapped into disjoint subsections of a single unified address space.

This enhancement simplifies several of the already-introduced CUDA memory management commands~(\cite{nvidia2011cudac40}, 3.2.7).
The \texttt{cudaMemcpyDefault} flag for \texttt{cudaMemcpy} instructs the CUDA system to automatically determine how to move data.
By examining the address of the pointers passed to \texttt{cudaMemcpy}, CUDA determines where which device the memory resides on and moves it accordingly.
This simplifies the programmer's use of \texttt{cudaMemcpy}, as \texttt{cudaMemcpyDefault} may be used everywhere.
There is also no need to call \texttt{cudaHostGetDevicePointer} for mapped allocations.
Furthermore, all mapped allocations are automatically accessible by all GPUs in the system, not restricted to the GPU that was active at the time of the allocation.
\texttt{cudaMemcpyPeer} is no longer needed for device-to-device memory copies; \texttt{cudaMemcpy} may be used instead.

\subsection{Peer Access and UVA}
\label{sec:cuda-peer}



Peer access was introduced with CUDA 4.0.
\texttt{cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess()} allows CC 2.0+ devices to address memory in another device's address space~(\cite{nvidia2011cudac40}, 3.2.6.4).
For example, if GPU1 loads through a pointer to data on GPU0, the data will be directly fetched from GPU0 memory, at the cost of one PCIe transaction and one global memory load~\cite{schroeder2011peer}, and be cached in the L2 of GPU0.
Direct peer access requires compute capability 2.0, CUDA 4.0,Fermi+, and 64-bit system.
The availability of peer access may rely on a combination of interconnect topology and system hardware, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:cuda-peer-topology}.
When peer access is disabled, data transfers first pass through the host instead of allowing direct DMA between devices.

\end{table}

\subsection{Unified Memory with CC 3.0+ (Kepler+)}
\label{sec:unified-cc3}

The CUDA unified memory system was introduced with CUDA 6.0 and requires a GPU with SM architecture of 3.0 or higher~\cite{nvidia2014cuda60}.
CUDA Unified Memory~\cite{harris2013cudaunifiedmemory} provides a single pool of memory that is accessible from the CPU and GPU by a single pointer.
CUDA automatically migrates data between the physically distinct CPU and GPU memory as needed, allowing GPU kernels to access the memory as if it were in the global memory, and CPU functions to access the memory as if it were in the system memory.
Like mapped memory, this simplifies programming by removing the need for separate host and device allocations and explicit data transfers.
A summary of unified memory APIs are shown in Table~\ref{tab:cuda-um-apis}

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\caption[CUDA Unified Memory-Management APIs]{
		CUDA Unified Memory-Management APIs.
		Initial CUDA 6.0 APIs and additional CUDA 8.0 APIs are shown.
	}
	\label{tab:cuda-um-apis}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{cY}
		\hline
		\textbf{CUDA 6 and CC3.0+}           & \textbf{Description}                        \\ \hline
		\texttt{\_\_managed\_\_}             & Defines a global variable in managed memory \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaMallocManaged()}         & allocate a unified memory region.           \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaStreamAttachMemAsync()}  & Attach a managed allocation to a stream, instead of globally. \\ \hline \hline

		\texttt{cudaMemPrefetchAsync()}      & Hint to prefetch memory to device  \\ \hline
		\texttt{cudaMemAdvise()}             & Hint about how memory will be used \\ \hline

	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The underlying data is only present in one location on the system, and in principle, unified memory allocations are automatically migrated towards their most recent use.
When a kernel is launched, all pages attached to that kernel's stream are bulk migrated to the destination GPU.
When the host program touches a page, that page is migrated back to the system memory.
In Multi-GPU systems, data does not migrate between GPUs - all other GPUs receive peer mappings to the data, which is accessed over the PCIe bus (\cite{nvidia2014cuda60}, J.1.3).

Unified memory maintains coherence (i.e., all GPUs the CPU have the same view of unified memory values) by disallowing concurrent accesses to managed data, including concurrent access to distinct managed allocations (\cite{nvidia2014cuda60}, J.2.2.1).
The CPU may access managed allocations after GPU execution has completed, where ``GPU execution'' refers to activity in a particular stream for stream-attached memory, or whole-GPU otherwise.
For stream-attached memory, completion of GPU execution can be guaranteed by any stream-synchronizing call.
For whole-GPU memory, completion is guaranteed by stream synchronization when only one stream is executing on the GPU\footnote{e.g., \texttt{cudaStreamSynchronize()}}, or by any call that is fully synchronous with respect to the host\footnote{e.g., \texttt{cudaDeviceSynchronize()}}.
The GPU is considered to be active even if it is not accessing managed data.
Concurrent inter-GPU accesses are allowed, as are concurrently-executing kernels on a single GPU (\cite{nvidia2014cuda60}, J.2.2.2).

\subsection{Unified Memory with CC 6.0+ (Pascal+)}
\label{sec:unified-cc6}

With CUDA 8 and for GPUs with CC 6.0+, GPU page faulting provides a more fine-grained data transfer mechanism~\cite{nvidia2017cuda80}.
Instead of moving all managed allocations to the GPU prior to a kernel launch, the GPU will fault if it accesses a page that is not in its memory.
The page is either migrated to the GPU to serve that access, or the page is mapped into the GPU address space to be accessed over the host-device interconnect.
Unlike Unified Memory with CC 3.0, pages can migrate between GPUs on peer accesses (\cite{nvidia2017cuda80}, J.1.4).
The GPU page faulting mechanism lifts all restrictions on simultaneous access to data (\cite{nvidia2017cuda80}, J.2.2.1).
However, intensive interleaving of CPU and GPU accesses to a page can cause excessive migrations and result in severe performance degradation.

CC 6.0+ also brings 49-bit virtual addressing to cover the 48-bit virtual addressing of modern CPUs and the GPU memory.
This allows CUDA to support managed allocations larger than the GPU memory.
The total amount of managed allocations still cannot be larger than the system memory (\cite{nvidia2017cuda80}, J.1.3).

\texttt{cudaMemPrefetchAsync()} hints to the unified memory system that a particular device will soon be accessing a unified memory allocation.
This may cause the system to migrate the specific region of memory over to the referenced device.
This hint is used in Chapter~\ref{ch:explicit} in some of the unified memory characterizations.

\texttt{cudaMemAdvise()} hints to the unified memory system how a particular region of memory can be used.
\texttt{cudaMemAdviseSetReadMostly} causes the hinted device to establish a read-only copy of a page, instead of taking complete ownership of a page on access.
Any writes to that page become expensive, as all read-only copies must be invalidated.
This cost is not evaluated in this work.
\texttt{cudaMemAdviseSetPreferredLocation} hints to the driver that data migration of the page away from the device should be avoided.
This may cause the system to establish a remote mapping for the data, instead of migrating the page.
\texttt{cudaMemAdviseSetAccessedBy} hints to the driver that the device will access the memory region.
It causes the page to be mapped in the device page table for as long as possible, to prevent page faults on access.

\subsection {Unified Memory with CC 7.0+ (Volta+) }
Though not examined in this work, Volta GPUs contain the necessary hardware for more intelligent migration of pages.
When support is added in the Nvidia driver, access counters will be used to trigger page migrations of hot pages, instead of on each access.
The system will also detect thrashing, and temporarily prevent page faults to allow faster progress on each device.
On POWER9 systems, the CPU and GPU have access to each other's page translation hardware, allowing memory accesses on the CPU to be served from the GPU and cached on the CPU.
Furthermore, the CPU can execute atomic operations on locations in GPU memory without a page migration~\cite{sakharnykh2017unified}).

\section{Linux Non-Uniform Memory Access}
\label{sec:numa}

Linux includes a system for exposing non-uniform memory access architectures (NUMA) to applications.
In NUMA systems, memory is divided into multiple \textit{nodes}\cite{numa2012}.
Processors and devices have the same access characteristics when accessing memory in a particular node.
Nodes have \textit{affinity} to processors and devices, indicating the processors and devices which can access that node with the best performance.

This is particularly relevant on multi-socket systems, though some single-socket systems also feature NUMA characteristics.
For example, every system considered by this work and described in Section~\ref{sec:system-descriptions} is a NUMA system.
On the AC922 (Figure~\ref{fig:topo-ac922-simple}), GPU0 is directly connected to CPU0 and GPU2 is directly connected to CPU1.
If an allocation on CPU0 were to be copied to GPU2, the data would traverse the CPU-CPU X bus, and then the CPU-to-GPU NVLink.
On the other hand, if an allocation on CPU1 were to be copied to GPU2, that data would only have to traverse the NVLink.
This can have a substantial effect on available bandwidth, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:numa-bw-example}.
Chapters~\ref{ch:explicit} and ~\ref{ch:unified} show these effects in more detail.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/generated/ac922_numa-bw.pdf}
    \caption[Example of NUMA Bandwidth Effects on AC922]{Example NUMA Bandwidth Effects on AC922}
    \label{fig:numa-bw-example}
\end{figure}

Applications can leverage the numactl\cite{wickman2015numactl} library to affect their own NUMA execution policy.
This policy controls on which CPUs processes may execute, and on which NUMA nodes memory is allocated.
numactl is used in this work to ensure that data is allocated and programs execute on specific CPUs as needed to exercise different underlying hardware links.

\section{Profiling Tooling}
\label{sec:profiling}

\subsection{CUDA Profiling Tools Interface}
\label{sec:cupti}

The CUDA Profiling Tools Interface~\cite{nvidia2017cupti} (CUPTI) ``provides...detailed information about how applications are using the GPU in a system.''
Users may inject code into the entry and exit point of every CUDA C Runtime and CUDA Driver API function call.
Additionally, users may configure and query hardware and software event counters to get insight into the operation of the GPU and CUDA stack.
The event counters include instruction count, instruction throughput, memory loads/stores, memory throughput, cache hits/misses, branches and custom profile triggers.
Chapter~\ref{ch:future} describes how CPUTI can be used to record memory allocations, kernel arguments, and timestamps to build a model of the application execution.

\subsection{\texttt{LD\_PRELOAD}}
\label{sec:ldpreload}

LD\_PRELOAD~\cite{kerrisk2017ld} is a mechanism by which the ld linker will load additional user-specific shared objects before any others.
If a function definition is present in a pre-loaded shared object, it will override the implementation present in later objects.
When combined with \texttt{dlsym()}~\cite{kerrisk2017dlysm}, it can be used to inject code into the entry of library calls in dynamically-linked binaries.
Chapter~\ref{ch:future} describes how LD\_PRELOAD can be used to infer information about application activity based on generic library calls.


\section{Benchmark Library}
\label{sec:benchmark}

This work makes use of the Google Benchmark library~\cite{google2018benchmark} as a harness for the developed custom microbenchmarks.
Benchmark supports manual or automatic timing, multithreaded benchmarks, and some control over code optimization.
The microbenchmarks developed for this thesis make use of all of those features.

Some of the microbenchmarks in this work make use of CUDA events to accurately measure the time taken by various CUDA operations.



Benchmark allows microbenchmarks to be specified in C++ using the following pattern:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption=Benchmark structure, label=lst:benchmark-automatic]
#include <benchmark/benchmark.h>

static void BM_StringCreation(benchmark::State& state) {
  for (auto _ : state)
	std::string empty_string;
}
// Register the function as a benchmark
BENCHMARK(BM_StringCreation);

// Define another benchmark
static void BM_StringCopy(benchmark::State& state) {
  std::string x = "hello";
  for (auto _ : state)
	std::string copy(x);
}
BENCHMARK(BM_StringCopy);

BENCHMARK_MAIN();

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption=Benchmark structure, label=lst:benchmark-manual]
static void BM_ManualTiming(benchmark::State& state) {
	int microseconds = state.range(0);
	std::chrono::duration<double, std::micro> sleep_duration {
	  static_cast<double>(microseconds)
	};
  
	for (auto _ : state) {
	  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
	  // Simulate some useful workload with a sleep
	  std::this_thread::sleep_for(sleep_duration);
	  auto end   = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  
	  auto elapsed_seconds =
		std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::duration<double>>(
		  end - start);
  
	  state.SetIterationTime(elapsed_seconds.count());
	}
}
BENCHMARK(BM_ManualTiming)->Range(1, 1<<17)->UseManualTime();
\end{lstlisting}

\section{System Descriptions}
\label{sec:system-descriptions}

Three high-performance heterogeneous systems are used in this work: an IBM S822LC for High Performance Computing~\cite{caldeira2016s822lc}, an IBM AC922~\cite{caldeira2018ac922}, and an Nivida DGX-1~\cite{nvidia2017dgx1}.
All systems feature multiple GPUs and multiple socketed CPUs.
Their key differences are in CPU architecture (64-bit little-endian PowerPC for S822LC and AC922, x86-64 for DGX-1), number of GPUs (4 for the IBM machines, 8 for Nvidia), and GPU connection topology (NVLink 1.0 for S822LC, NVLink 2.0 for AC922, and hybrid PCIe 3.0 / NVLink 1.0 for DGX-1).

Table~\ref{tab:dgx1} and Figure \ref{fig:topo-dgx-simple} summarizes the Nvidia DGX-1 system architecture.
The Nvidia DGX-1 machine consists of two symmetric sections\cite{nvidia2017dgx1}.
