The conclusions drawn from the study are given in the last chapter.
The last chapter also can include discussions of the advantages and limitations of the results obtained, comparisons with previous work, possible applications for the results, and suggestions for future work.

\outline{

Possible future work:

    Library interface for moving data

    Characterizing direct peer access
    Monitoring application direct peer access
    More communication links {ethernet}
    Proper characterization of multiple paths when available
    Multi-node system model
    Proper SMP bus topology  detection
    CUDA system atomics characterization?
    non-compressible data for cuda memcpy?

    Investigating the hardware topology scheduling problem
    Simulation and Replay of Profiles
}

\todo{Investigating performance details (radare2, callgrind)?}
