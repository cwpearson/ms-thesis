\chapter{Application Characterization}

Without a characterization application components and their communication patterns, the system characterization has limited utility.


\section{Application Model}

The application is represented by a graph $G_a = \{E_a,V_a\}$ where $E_a$ is a set of edges representing data transfer, and $V_a$ is a set of vertices representing separate compute processes.
$v_a \in V_a$ is considered to be a GPU CUDA stream or CPU operating system process.
$e_a \in E_a$ is an edge with a set of transfers defined by
\begin{enumerate}
    \item start time
    \item stop time
    \item transfer size
\end{enumerate}
\todo{What to do better here.}

\section{Application Monitoring}

A custom application trace is generated during an application execution to build the application graph.
\todo{apptracer} is built on top of CUDA Profiling Tools Interface~\cite{nvidia2017cupti}(CUPTI) and the Linux \texttt{LD\_PRELOAD}~\cite{kerrisk2017ld} mechanism.
CUPTI allows \todo{apptracer} to provide a callback function that is invoked at every CUDA runtime or driver call, and also allows \todo{apptracer} to collect any performance metrics the GPU exposes.
The callback function records relevant information, including the wall time when the CUDA runtime function is invoked, its arguments, and the device and stream associated with the call.
In this way, detailed information about data transfers from runtime functions can be collected.

Additionally, conservative data consumption and generation from CUDA kernels can be inferred.
Any arguments that point to previously-recorded allocations are assumed to modify that allocation.
\todo{through monitoring the device metrics, it is possible to understand how much data is read and written through those pointers in aggregate.}
