\section{System Topology Enumeration}

hwloc~\cite{broquedis2010hwloc} provides a tree of system components, while modern heterogeneous systems are better described as a graph.

\todo{OS support for this sort of thing.}

\section{System Characterization}

MGBench, a multi-GPU communication benchmark~\cite{bennun2016mgbench}.

\section{Application Characterization}

\outline{
    Kahn Process Model?
}

\section{Dependence Graph Scheduling}

\cite{amaral2017topology} use a similar hardware model, graph partitioning, estimating communication cost.

\cite{gomez2013performance} some microbenchmarks for atomics latency.
