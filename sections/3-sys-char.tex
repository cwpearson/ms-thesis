\chapter{System Characterization}
\label{ch:sys-char}

High-performance data movement in heterogeneous systems requires information about the properties of the communication links between system storage and compute components.
Although specifications of system components are often available\todo{cite some examples}, the real-world properties of these links depends on how applications use the links, and whether or not the links are shared between system components.
\todo{For example, Figure~\ref{fig:actual-perf} shows modeled and achieved cuda memcpy bandwidth.}
With full knowledge of link properties it is possible to derive an accurate model of link performance, that approach has two key barriers
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detailed link hardware properties are not available, e.g., when the link provides a competitive advantage for an OEM.
    \item Detailed link software properies are not available, e.g., when the drivers are proprietary.
    \item Even if a link is pysically present on the system, it may not be available to the application {e.g., due to bugs in the system configuration}
\end{itemize}
Instead of deriving a model of link performance from the ``first principles'' of link properties, this work attempts to generate an empirical model of performance of data movement in the system.
Section~\ref{sec:system-model} describes an overview of the system model.
Section~\ref{sec:topology-exploration} describes a method for discovering data sources, sinks, and communication paths in a system.
Section~\ref{sec:link-char} describes the approach to characterize communication links.

\section{System Model}
\label{sec:system-model}

The harware system is represented by a graph $G_s = \{E,V\}$ where $E$ is a set of edges representing communication links, and $V$ is a set of vertices representing data sources/sinks.
Sections~\ref{sec:system-vertices} and \ref{sec:system-edges} describe the specific system components explored.
Associated with each edge is a performance model function $M: C,U \rightarrow P$ that maps a communication pattern $C$ and a link utilization $U$ to an achievable performance $P$.

The communication pattern $P$ has the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The communication API or method used (e.g., \texttt{fread()}, CUDA unified memory page transfer).
    \item The number, size, and priority of pending transfers on the link.
\end{itemize}

The link utilization $U$ a set of extant communication patterns already sharing the link, separate from the communication of interest $C$.



Each vertex in $V$ represents a data source/sink.

\section{Topology Exploration}
\label{sec:topology-exploration}

The topology exploration is done in several phases:

\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enumerate and link CPU sockets
    \item Enumerate PCI devices
    \item Update GPUs to NVIDIA GPUs as appropriate
    \item Enumerate Linux block devices
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

First, the Portable Hardware Locality~\cite{broquedis2010hwloc} (hwloc) library is used to enumerate the present CPU sockets.
As the test systems only have two sockets, all discovered sockets are considered to be directly connected by an SMP bus.
Next, hwloc is used to descend through the PCI device tree and connect all PCI devices with PCI links of the appropriate type.
Next, the NVIDIA Management Library~\cite{nvidia2017nvml} (NVML) is used to enumerate all NVIDIA GPUs.
Those GPUs are matched by PCI address with previously-discovered PCI devices and information about those GPUs is added to $G_s$.
NVML is then used to discover whether NVLink is supported on each GPU, and which device the NVLink terminates at.
Finally, linux block devices are enumerated through \todo{more detail} and added to $G_s$.

\subsection{Vertex Types}

\section{Link Characterization}
\label{sec:link-char}

After the system graph $G_s$ has been generated, the next task is to characterize the communication capabilities of the system.
For each pair of vertices, the \todo{software} determines whether direct communication between those vertices is supported.
Some links, like CPU socket-socket links (e.g., edge ``SMP'' in Figure~\ref{fig:simple-topology}) implicity communicate without direct control from a vendor library or OS component.
Other links, like CPU-GPU PCIe links (e.g., edge ``PCIe'' in Figure~\ref{fig:simple-topology}), must be directly controlled through a vendor API such as CUDA or OpenCL.
Some endpoints may also communicate over multiple links (Socket 0 with GPU0 in Figure~\ref{fig:simple-topology}).
