I would like to thank my thesis advisor Professor Wen-Mei Hwu of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
He allowed me to make this my own work, but his door was always open when I needed guidance.

I would also like to thank the members of the IMPACT research group for their insight and assistance, and for creating such a fruitful research environment.

I would also like to acknowledge Dominic Grande and Nishant Dash, who collaborated extensively in the development of the software tools described in this thesis.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the entities that financially supported this work, including the Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research.
